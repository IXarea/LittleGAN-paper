\section{Introduction}
As an important characteristic, face makes a difference in interpersonal activities.
In daily life, it is necessary to get specific persons' images on various occasions.
For example, pass the portrait information of strangers and get an image of a person different from the state in picture.
In recent years, machine learning has developed deeply.
Facial image generation and adjustment are one of the directions.

Combined with the technology of facial identification, facial image generation can be used to determine identity.
The technology mainly applies to identity verification, used to chase targets, which is a vital auxiliary method to combat criminal activities.
As for social activities, it can also be utilized to the identification in intelligent interaction scene.
For example, security check at school gates and the check point of companys.

Nowadays, public safety agency mainly adopt following methods to get facial images.
According to the description of eyewitness, corporate with painters to get rough facial images,
    search for the figure in existing image database and determine the identity of the figure.
We assume the method has large shortcomings.
First, perspective of painters will affect generation of the portrait.
    Second, there will be high requirements for users.
    Third, real-time performance is poor.
Another method is getting photos by photography. However, photographing angle may also be poor.
In order to track and position targets, photos need to be accurate.
The research on adjusting the attributes of facial image is used to solve this problem.
This research has certain practical significance in the fields, which aquires facial images more quickly.
