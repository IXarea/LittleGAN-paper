\section{Introduction}

In recent years, machine learning has gone deeply in the society.
Facial image generation and adjustment are one of the directions.
As an important characteristic, face makes a difference in the interpersonal activities.
Combined with the technology of face identification, facial image generation can be used to define identity.
The technology mainly applies to identity authentication, used to chase the target, which is a vital auxiliary method to combat criminal activities.
When it comes to social activities, it can also be utilized to the identification of intelligent interaction scene, for example, the safety detection at the school gate and the check point of the company.

Nowadays, under the circumstances of the disability to get the exact figure,
    public safety agency mainly adopt the following method.
According to the description of eyewitness, corporate with the painter to get the rough facial image,
    search for the figure in the existent image data base and confirm the identity of the figure.
We assume that the method has large shortcomings.
First, the subjective consciousness of the painter will affect the generation of the portrait.
    The second is that the painter's painting quality is higher and the cost is higher,
    and the third is that the speed of image generation is higher in certain occasions.
The method of tracking and positioning according to the photo of the target person may also cause the face of the target person to be inaccurate due to the problem of poor photographing angle or the long time of taking photos.
The research on adjusting the attribute of the facial image is used to solve this problem.
This research has certain practical significance in the fields that need the images of accurate target figures more quickly,
    such as accurate positioning targets in criminal investigation and speeding up the speed of solving crimes.
