\section{Introduction}
In daily life, it is necessary to get specific persons' images on various occasions,
    for example, passing the portrait information of strangers and getting different states of a person.
In recent years, machine learning has spread to all aspects of society.
Facial image generation and adjustment is an emerging subfield.

Combined with the technology of facial identification,
    facial image generation can be used to redefine identity.
More than any other body part, the face defines who we are.
Facial recognition is often used for identification.
For Facebook it is a tool of convenience for tagging friends,
    in China it is a vital method for combatting crime.
When it comes to social activities, it can also be utilized for the identification.
For example, identity authentication at a school gate or the reception in an office.

The long standing method for authorities to identify a suspect seen by an eyewitness is to have a painter get a rough facial image,
    search for the figure in the existent image data base and then finally confirm the identity of the figure.
This method has large shortcomings.
First, the biases of painters will affect generation of the portrait.
The second is that the cost of the rendering increases sharply with the quality.
And the third is that real-time performance is poor.
Another method is getting photos by photography.
However, there will be problems like poor photographing angle or the slow exposure.
In order to track and position targets, photos need to be accurate.
LittleGAN on adjusting the attributes of facial image is used to solve this problem.
This research has certain practical significance for the fields that require accurate facial images,
    such as in the accurate positioning of targets in criminal investigation or the securing of the entrance of a building.
