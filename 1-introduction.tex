\section{Introduction}
In recent years, machine learning has spread to all aspects of society.
Facial image generation and adjustment is an emerging subfield with many applications.

More than any other body part, the face is the best suited for identification,
    which is why facial recognition is often used for identification.
For Facebook, AI facial recognition is a tool of convenience for tagging friends.
Off the internet, it is also a vital method for combatting crime.




The long standing method for authorities to identify a suspect seen by an eyewitness is to have a painter sketch a rough facial image,
    search for the image in the existent image database and then finally confirm the identity of the image.
This method has large shortcomings.
First, the biases of painters will affect the generation of the portrait.
The second is that the cost of the rendering increases sharply with the quality.
And the third is that process is filled with delays.
Another method is getting photos from cameras.
However, security cameras have many problems like poor photographing angle and exposure problem, etc.
In order to identify targets, photos need to be accurate.
Facial image generation can be used to aid a sketch artist.
LittleGAN, by adjusting the attributes of facial images is used to solve this problem.
LittleGAN may have practical significance in fields requiring accurate facial images,
    such as suspect identification or the securing of the entrance of a building.
