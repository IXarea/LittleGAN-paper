\section{Target and Highlight}

\subsection{Research Target}
\begin{itemize}
\item We propose a machine learning technology based, workable, convenient and efficient solution,
    addressing the needs of facial image generation and adjustment.
    Replace traditional methods which have certain defects.
    For example, poor real-time performance and time consuming.
\item Combine current demand and most up-to-date work, 
    improve the model and training methods to reduce the size of the model and the use-cost.
\item Use new methods to adjust images so as to reduce information loss of original image.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Research Highlight}
\begin{itemize}
\item Propose a model to fulfill three tasks of facial image attribute recognition,
    conditional generation and adjustment with one model.
    Effectively reduce model size.
    Cut down the computational load in training and runtime.
    Achieve the purpose of reducing the use-cost of training, deployment and running.
\item Propose and apply partition training method.
    It alleviates the problem of vanishing gradients in previous layers of deep network.
    Speed up the network convergence and further reduce training calculation.

\item Adjust facial images in the image space to reduce the information loss of original image.
