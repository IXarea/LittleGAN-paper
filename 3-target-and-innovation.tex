\section{Target and Highlight}

\subsection{Research Target}
\begin{itemize}
\item We propose a machine learning technology based, workable, convenient and efficient solution,
    addressing the needs of facial image generation and adjustment.
    Replace traditional methods which have certain defects. For example, poor real-time performance and time consuming.
\item Combine current demand and most up-to-date work, 
    improve the model and training methods to reduce the size of the model and the use-cost.
\item Use new methods to adjust the image so as to reduce the information loss of original image during the adjustment.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Research Highlight}
\begin{itemize}
\item Propose a model to fulfill three tasks of facial image attribute recognition,
    conditional generation and adjustment with one model.
    Effectively reduce the model size. Cut down the computational load in training and runtime.
    Achieve the purpose of reducing the training, deployment, and running use-cost.
\item Propose and apply the partition training method to solve the problem that vanishing gradients occurs in previous layers in deep network so that speed up the network convergence and further reduce the training calculation.

\item Adjusts the facial image in the image space to reduce the information loss of original image during the adjustment.
