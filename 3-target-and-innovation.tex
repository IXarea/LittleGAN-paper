\section{Target and Innovation}

In order to provide a more suitable solution for facial image generation and adjustment,
    we decide to use machine learning technology to probe.

\subsection{Research Target}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use machine learning technology to propose a workable,
    convenient and efficient method for providing a new solution to the needs of facial image generation and adjustment.
    Replace traditional methods which have certain defects. For example, poor real-time performance and time consuming.
\item Combine current demand and most up-to-date work, 
    innovatively improve the model and training methods to reduce the size of the model and the cost.
\item Use new methods to adjust the image so as to reduce the information loss of original image during the adjustment.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Research Innovation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Propose a model to fulfill three tasks of facial image attribute recognition,
    conditional generation and adjustment with one model.
    Effectively reduce the model size so that the computational load in training and runtime is cut down.
    Achieve the purpose of reducing the training, deployment, and running use-cost.
\item Propose and apply the part training method to solve the problem that vanishing gradients occurs in previous layers in deep network so that speed up the network convergence and further reduce the training calculation.

\item Adjusts the facial image in the image space to reduce the information loss of original image during the adjustment.
\end{itemize}
