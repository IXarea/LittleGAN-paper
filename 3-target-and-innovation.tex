\section{Goal and Highlight}

\subsection{Research Goal}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Propose a machine learning technology based, workable, convenient and efficient solution,
    addressing the needs of facial image generation and adjustment.
It can replace traditional methods which have certain defects, such as poor real-time performance and time consuming.
\item
Combine current demand and most up-to-date work to improve the model and training methods.
Reduce size and use-cost of model.
\item
Use new methods to adjust images so as to reduce information loss of original image.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Research Highlight}
\begin{itemize}
\item
We propose a model to fulfill three tasks of facial image attribute recognition,
    conditional generation and adjustment with one model.
We effectively reduce model size.
We cut down computational load in training and runtime.
We achieve the purpose of reducing use-cost of training, deployment and running.
\item
We propose and apply partition training method.
It alleviates the problem of vanishing gradients in previous layers of deep network.
It also speeds up the network convergence and further reduce training calculation.

\item
We adjust facial images in the image space to reduce the information loss of original image.
\end{itemize}
