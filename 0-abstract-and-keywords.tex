In daily life, it is often necessary to pass portrait information, such as obtaining images from eyewitness in public security.
However, traditional method has some disadvantages and existing machine learning model's use-cost is too high.
Through a large scale of experiments, we propose a single multi-task model for conditional facial image generation and adjustment.
The proposed model based on DCGAN, inspired by pix2pix and PGGAN.
Major improvements are as follows.
We share parameters between GAN and Adjustor,
    reducing the size of the model and use-cost compared to two individual models.
We adjust images in the image space,
    reducing the loss of original image information.
We propose a method of partition training,
    making deep neural network easier to train.
It is validated that the model can validly generate plausible facial images from attributes and be adjusted by attributes.
Results also suggest that the use-cost of LittleGAN has declined.
Compared to DCGAN and pix2pix, it can be more effectively applied to the actual production activity.
