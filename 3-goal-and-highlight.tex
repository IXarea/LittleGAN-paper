\section{Goal and Highlight}

\subsection{Research Goal}
\begin{itemize}
%todo
\item
Propose a machine learning technology network that addresses the needs of facial image generation and adjustment for real-time applications
It can replace traditional methods which have certain defects, such as poor real-time performance and time consuming.
\item
Combine current demand and most up-to-date work to improve the model and training methods,
    and to reduce the size and use-cost of resulting models.
\item
Apply new methods to adjust images so as to reduce information loss of original image.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Research Highlight}
\begin{itemize}
\item
We propose a single model to perform three tasks: facial image attribute recognition,
    conditional generation and adjustment.
We effectively reduce model size and cut down computational load in training and runtime by sharing parameters.
We achieve the purpose of reducing the use-cost of training, deployment and running.
\item
We propose and apply partition training method.
It alleviates the problem of vanishing gradients in previous layers of deep network,
    make it easier for deep neural networks to find the global minimum.

\item
%todo
We adjust facial images in the image space to reduce the information loss of original image.
