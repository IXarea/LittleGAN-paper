\section{Goal and Highlight}

\subsection{Research Goal}
Provide a
facial image generation and adjustment model
with good performance
and low use-cost

\begin{itemize}
\item
Propose a machine learning technology network that addresses the needs of facial image generation and adjustment for real-time applications.
It can replace traditional methods that have certain defects, such as poor real-time performance and time consuming.
\item
Combine current demand and most up-to-date work to improve the model and training methods,
    and to reduce the size and use-cost of resulting models.
\item
Apply new methods to adjust images so as to reduce information loss of original image.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Research Highlight}
\begin{itemize}
\item
We propose a single model to perform two tasks: conditional generation and adjustment.
Also, the model has a good performance.
\item
We effectively reduce model size and cut down computational load in training and runtime by sharing parameters.
We achieve the purpose of reducing the use-cost of training, deployment and running.
\item
We propose and apply partition training method.
It alleviates the problem of vanishing gradients in previous layers of deep network,
    make it easier for deep neural networks to find the global minimum.

\item
We adjust facial images in the image space to reduce the information loss of original image.
